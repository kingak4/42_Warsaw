42 Warsaw – Common Core Projects
This repository contains my implementations of projects from the Common Core curriculum at 42 Warsaw. Each project helped me progress in programming with C and understanding low-level concepts.

📚 libft
My own library of standard C functions, later used in other projects.
What I learned: implementing library functions, memory management, clean coding practices.

🖨️ ft_printf
Reimplementation of the printf function.
What I learned: text formatting, type conversions, handling variadic functions.

📄 get_next_line
Function to read a file line by line.
What I learned: working with file descriptors, buffering, efficient memory handling.

🎮 so_long
A simple 2D game built with the MiniLibX graphic library.
What I learned: 2D graphics rendering, event handling (keyboard), game logic, and map parsing.

🔄 push_swap
Sorting program using a restricted set of stack operations.
What I learned: sorting algorithms, optimization strategies, data structure manipulation.

🔗 pipex
Recreation of shell pipelines (e.g. ls | grep .c).
What I learned: processes, pipes, system calls, and UNIX environment handling.

🧘 philosophers
Implementation of the “Dining Philosophers Problem”.
What I learned: multithreading, synchronization, mutexes, and avoiding deadlocks.
